# Farasa-Arabic-Analyzer-Google-Docs-PlugIn

## Key Uses 

Integrated Farasa API into the plugin, gives users an exceptional tool for precise Arabic linguistic analysis.

Enable users working with Arabic Text on Google Docs by providing them parts-of-speech (POS) highlighting.

## Process

The system has two functionalities: 

 1- Display the linguistic information on the sidebar:

Extract the selected text (by the user) from the document.
Send the selected text to Farasa API (segmentation, lemmatization, spell checker, and diacritization).
Get Farasaâ€™s response and display it on the sidebar. 

2- Highlight the part of speech of the selected text:

Extract the selected text (by the user) from the document.
Send the selected text to the POS Farasa API.
Highlight the selected sentence (nouns in green, verbs in blue, particles in yellow).


## Challanges 

1- Farasa API Integration Complexity:

Technical challenges. 
Data formatting. 
Error handling.

2- Latency:
